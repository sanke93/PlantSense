PlantSense
==========

Current Arduino project that detects soil moisture and if low notifies an android phone through Notify My Android. The sensor is made using Arduino, and soil moisture sensor using nails along with a photocell. The data read from the sensor is used to compare to the optimal plant moisture level and notifies if it's low.  

I will soon be uploading the exact specifications of the sensors and connections used, if anyone wants to try that. 

##This project is still undergoing so no guarentees if it's going to work accurately.
